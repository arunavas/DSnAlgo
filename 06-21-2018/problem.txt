A matrix of L (Land) & W (Water/Pond) is given. 
Connected W denotes as Single Pond/Water.
Connected L denotes as
Single Land.
Find out the number of Pond.
Suppose, due to natural disasters like flood, Land becomes flooded and acquired by Water.
Now, we need to find out minimum number of flood/disaster, which can cause single pond or water.

  0 1 2 3 4
0 W W L L L
1 L L L W L
2 L W L L L
3 L L W L W

Here, 
Pond {(0,0)(0,1)}
Pond {(1,3)}
Pond {(2,1)(3,2)}
Pond {(3,4)}

Here 2 changes required,
Let's change (3,3) and (1,2)

  0 1 2 3 4
0 W W L L L
1 L L # W L
2 L W L L L
3 L L W # W
