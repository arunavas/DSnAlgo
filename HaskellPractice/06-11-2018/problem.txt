Given a random mtrix of size MxN and a positive integer number n, find the shortest continuous path starting from position 0,0 which sums to n. Your program can only move up, right, down and left.

Example:

1 3 6
2 5 7
8 2 1
n=11.

Output - 1-3-8 [(0,0)-(1,0)-(2,0)]

Explanation - for 11 there could be 2 ways from 0,0.
1. 1,3,5,2
2. 1,2,8
Since 1,2,8 is shorter the answer is 2nd on.
